<h1 class="Header">Digital Technologies</h1>
<div class="digital"><p>Digital technologies are tools, systems, and devices that use digital data—information stored in binary form (0s and 1s)—to perform tasks, process information, and enable communication. <br> Unlike traditional analog technologies, digital technologies allow information to be created, stored, processed, and transmitted efficiently and accurately. <br> Over the past few decades, they have transformed the way individuals, businesses, and societies operate, becoming an essential part of daily life and the global economy. <br>

Examples of digital technologies include computers, smartphones, tablets, the internet, software applications, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, and digital communication platforms. <br> These technologies work together to automate tasks, enhance productivity, facilitate communication, and provide access to vast amounts of information at unprecedented speeds. <br>    For instance, smartphones combine computing, networking, and application software to allow users to communicate, learn, work, and entertain themselves from almost anywhere. <br>

Applications of digital technologies are widespread across multiple sectors. In education, digital tools such as e-learning platforms, <br> virtual classrooms, and online resources make knowledge more accessible and personalized. In healthcare,<br> technologies like electronic medical records, telemedicine, and wearable health devices improve patient care and monitoring. <br> In business, digital technologies streamline operations through e-commerce platforms, data analytics, and customer relationship management systems. <br> Moreover, in entertainment, social media, streaming services, and video games leverage digital innovations to deliver engaging content to audiences worldwide. <br></p></div>
